#Pattern

* best practices
* good designs
* capture experiences
* reusable

**NOT
* data structure
* algorithm 
* complex domain-specific designs


Descriptions of communicating objects / classes / structs / collections customized to
solve a general problem

In general, a pattern has four essential elements:  
1. **A name** that uniquely identifies the pattern from other patterns.  
2. **A problem** description that describes when to apply the  
pattern. It explains the problem and its context.  
3. **A solution** that describes the elements that make up the design,  
their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations. The  
solution doesnâ€˜t describe a particular concrete design or  
implementation, because a pattern is like a template that can be  
applied in many different situations.  
4. **A set of consequences** that describes the results and trade-offs  
of applying the pattern.
